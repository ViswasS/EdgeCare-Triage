# Key Features:

Patients can answer symptom-related questions through an easy-to-use questionnaire.

Patients can take/upload a photo of a rash or visible symptom for AI-based analysis.

The app provides a clear triage result within 10 seconds, guiding patients on whether they need medical care.

Doctors have access to a secure web portal where they can view patient reports, confirm or override AI decisions, and update patient history.

# **Overview**
EdgeCare Triage is a mobile and web app designed to give patients peace of mind before visiting a doctor. Using smart AI that runs directly on the phone, the app keeps personal health data private while providing quick and reliable results. Patients can simply answer a few health questions or snap a photo of a rash to find out if they need medical care within seconds. Doctors can then view these reports through a secure portal, confirm the results, or make adjustments as needed. By helping patients get instant guidance and supporting doctors with clear reports, EdgeCare Triage makes healthcare faster, safer, and more accessible for everyone.

## Benefits

Protects patient privacy by running AI on the device, rather than in the cloud.

Reduces unnecessary clinic visits by offering quick pre-screening.

Supports doctors with decision-ready reports to save time and improve accuracy.


# Technologies Used
**Front-end:**
Mobile App (Patient side): React Native (with Expo for quick setup), React Native Paper for UI components
Web App (Doctor portal): ReactJS + Material-UI (for professional dashboards)

**Backend:**
Firebase (Firestore for data, Firebase Auth for login, Firebase Storage for image uploads)
(Alternative: Supabase or a simple Node.js + Express backend if you want more control)

**Database:**
Firebase Firestore (NoSQL, real-time sync between patient and doctor views)

**AI Model:**
Image Classification: MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet-Lite (TensorFlow/Keras → TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference)
Symptom Classification: Logistic Regression or Decision Tree (scikit-learn, lightweight and easy to embed)
Fusion: Weighted decision rule combining image and symptom results

**Tools:**
Python (TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, OpenCV for preprocessing)
GitHub (version control, daily commits)
Figma (wireframes/designs if needed)
